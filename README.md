# Diversity-aware-Mutation-Testing

This repository contains resources regarding the following paper:

The main purpose of this implementation is experiments;
you can generate various mutation-adequate test suites (from the given test pool) 
using 
* (traditional) kill-only mutation adequacy criterion and
* (diversity-aware) distinguishing mutation adequacy criterion.


## Requirements

* JDK 11 (or higher)

## How to run; basic

All the required resources, 
including test pools (generated by developers, Randoop, and EvoSuite-branch) and mutants (generated by Major),
are there (under `resources/`). You can simply generate mutation-adequate test suites using them.

To do this, you need to run `src/TS_Experiment.java`. Inside, you can find many options you can play with.

If you simply run the file as it is, you will find the output files under `resources/testSuiteSelection_scoreControl`.


## Remarks

Unfortunately, it does not support "good" documentations for details.
You need to take a look the source codes. Everything is there.
However, you can use the "Issues" board if you have some questions. 
I will try to my best to reply your questions. Thanks!
